# Commity

![language: python][shield-language] ![license: GPL][shield-license] ![python: 3.7][shield-python-version] ![Commity CI/CD](https://github.com/Cynnexis/Commity/workflows/Commity%20CI/CD/badge.svg)

Commity is a script that print the commits from a git branch in a
user-friendly way using Markdown format, inspired from default
pull-requests templates in BitBucket.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

You need [Python 3.7][python 3.7] to execute this script.

Here is the command to install all necessary packages:

With pip:

```bash
pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt
```

With conda (and its environment):

```bash
conda install --name myenv -c conda-forge --file requirements.txt
```

### Installing

To install this script, you first need to clone this project, and
then execute [`commity.py`](https://github.com/Cynnexis/Commity/blob/master/commity.py).

> Note that if you want to change the source code of the project, you will need to run `yarn` in order to install the
> NPM modules. `Husky` is the module that help format the code using YAPF at each pre-commit.

### Usage

To execute Commity, you might need to specify some arguments:

* `-r` or `--repo`: The path to the git directory. By default,
the current folder is taken.
* `-b` or `--branch`: The name of the branch where to get the
commits. By default, the current branch is taken.
* `-o` or `--output`: The output file. All information will be written in the
given file. If the file is invalid, or no file is given, stdout is used instead.

**Example:**

`python commity.py -r C:\Users\Foo\MyProject -b feat/gui-buttons -o output.txt`

#### Run with Docker üê≥

It is possible to run `commity` from the given `Dockerfile`. Note that this method
is not optimized for this kind of usage, and is relatively long to execute, as you
will certainly have to build the image. Nevertheless, it is a good method if you
don't want to install Python and/or the required modules.

To execute `commity` using docker, please refer to the example below:

```bash
cd path/to/commity
docker build -t cynnexis/commity .
docker run -it -v "C:\Users\Foo\myproject:/myproject" cynnexis/commity run -r /myproject -b master -o /myproject/commity-output.txt
```

**Explanation:**

1. The first command is to move to the project repository.
2. Build the image, and name it "`cynnexis/commity`"
3. This command is the more complex one. It runs a container (`docker run -it`),
create a volume between your project on your host (your machine) and its copy
in the container (`-v "C:\Users\Foo\myproject:/myproject"`). Please replace the
first part with your project path on your host, and the second part with your
project name (with the `/` at the beginning). Then, the image name is specified
(`cynnexis/commity`), and the arguments are passed. After `run`, you can put any
arguments for `commity.py`. Make sure to replace `myproject` with your project
name again. If the command is successfully executed, you'll find the file
`commity-output.txt` under your project name on your host.
